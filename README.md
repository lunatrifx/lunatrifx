I'm a student attending San Diego State University.

## 🔭 Current

I'm currently working as a contributor to Epic Games' Unreal Engine 5 as a game and software developer. I previously worked as a backend developer on Aurora Virtual, a local and dynamic music player, similar to LimeWire or Spotify.

## ⚡️ Experience

My last major project that I created was called Addlyn-AI in 2017. It was a 4 stage project, ranging from aspects of architecture modeling in utilizing an arduino, AutoCAD, OpenAI, and self-created protocols for image analysis via CoreML and Clara via Nvidia.
