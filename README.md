I'm primarily a Nursing major (BSN) but I have completed various projects, trainings, and a degree in Computer Science. Here, I have a emphasis on Machine Learning and AI.

## üî≠ Current

I'm currently working as a backend personnel on Aurora Virtual, an upcoming local and dynamic music player. I am also leading Project Lavinium and Project Hera, more of which will be announced soon. In other facets, I am working on IT Certification from Apple and TEAS exam for Nursing school so please take this into consideration if I am late on replying to you.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Experience

I have certifications as a ML engineer from Coursera, alongside completion of several professional courses from IBM such as Applied Data Science Capstone. As for my projects, I have worked with APIs and webscraping (such as SpaceX), but my emphasis lies in Addlyn-AI - a machine learning project.
