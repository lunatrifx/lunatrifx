### Hello! Thank you for stopping by and visiting my tech portfolio.

I'm attending San Diego State University. I am pursing a BS in Neuroscience, and MS in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Astronomy. 

## 🔭 Current

I'm currently working as a Video Codec SDK Engineer through the NVIDIA Developer Program. I worked with the American Red Cross as a SAF/MEPS Data Analyst from May to August 2025.

## ⚡️ Experience

I am currently working on NVIDIA Cosmos. Driven by curiosity, I always want to look for the most power and storage efficient solutions for consumers; in addition to this I am driven to create video codec algorithms that present the best quality with any hardware. 

I am the creator of Addlyn, a CV model I've created when I was 15. I am looking to continue my work with Amerieca, another CV model but with significant upgrades to its predecessor.
