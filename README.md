### Hi everyone! My name is Paul.

[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=lunatrifx)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

I'm primarily a Nursing major (BSN) at Arizona State University.

## 🔭 Current

I'm currently working as a backend personnel on Aurora Virtual, an upcoming local and dynamic music player.

## ⚡️ Experience

I have been working on a project called Addlyn, which is a AI oriented program, since 2019 when I was 17. It orignally started as a Twitter bot, and when I rebranded it to Iris I turned it into a package I build upon or simply deploy into other projects I collaborate or create.
