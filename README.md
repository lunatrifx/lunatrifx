### Hello! Thank you for stopping by and visiting my tech portfolio.

[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=lunatrifx)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

I'm a undergraduate senior at San Diego State University.

## 🔭 Current

I'm currently working as a Video Codec SDK Engineer in accordance with NVIDIA. I also work at Engineers Without Borders as a Audiovisual Engineer, and I am involved with the Department of Defense via Correlation One. I worked with the American Red Cross as a SAF/MEPS Data Analyst from May to August 2025.

## ⚡️ Experience

My last and current project that I created was called Addlyn.ai in 2017, when I was 15. The project is currently on hold as I fine tune a much more precise goal that I want. I am currently working on Amerieca,a CV model akin to Tesla.
