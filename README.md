### Hello! Thank you for stopping by and visiting my tech portfolio.

[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=lunatrifx)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

I'm attending San Diego State University. I am pursing a BS in Neuroscience, and MS in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Astronomy. 

## 🔭 Current

I'm currently working as a Video Codec SDK Engineer in accordance with NVIDIA. I also work at Engineers Without Borders as a Audiovisual Engineer, and I am involved with the Department of Defense through Correlation One. I worked with the American Red Cross as a SAF/MEPS Data Analyst from May to August 2025.

## ⚡️ Experience

I am currently working on NVIDIA Cosmos. Driven by curiosity, I always want to look for the most power and storage efficient solutions for comsumers; in addition to this I am driven to create video codec algorithms that present the best quality with any hardware. 

I was the creator of Addlyn, a CV model I've created when I was 15. I am looking to continue my work with Amerieca, another CV model but with significant upgrades to its predecessor.
