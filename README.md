- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Paul a.k.a @lunatrifx!
- I am also @sinodal, I lost my github from login to access codes so I am locked out of that profile unfortunately. I am passionate about helping better academics for both myself and others around me. I use Machine Learning concepts and 90% of my projects revolve around a theme students often come to understand and experiment with in this field. If you are interested about what I do and want to support me, you can both support me with a follow or a sponsor! Either or both would make my day.
